  <!-- Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah? For real this time. This is it. My name is Amerrnath. I was consumed by JS. And for like four years , I've been the one and only Frontend Developer. I think you know the rest. I finished my essay. I saved a bunch of people. Got hit by a bug. . Met my destiny finally.And when I feel alone, like no one understands what I'm going through, I remember my friends who get it. I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff. But I can. Anyone can code. You can code. If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now. Cuz I'm Web developer. And I'm not the only one. Not by a long shot. -->
